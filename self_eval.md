# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It's useful to use a conditional to create an outcome for a variable. A variable can mean something specific and a conditional can define it as being true or false. If a variable is defined as `is_sleepy = true` then a conditional like: 
`if is_sleepy == true
 puts "zzzzz"
 end`
 will give the outcome in ruby to print "zzzzz".
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I think the amount of files in the repository intimidated me and made me feel like I had a lot more work than was actually inside of each segments of the assignment. I would tell myself to focus on breaking off little chunks instead of getting overwhelmed by what seems to be a large chunk of work in this assignment.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Writing and testing the code in the if_statements.rb felt the most satisfying. I was able to check the code and get it to work without issue most of the time and if I had an error I was able to deduce what the issue was fairly quickly.
